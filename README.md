## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

By just the division tags how they make the certain parts of the component

```
<div id="">
  <div class="">
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div class="">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I want it to improve my CSS skills since I feel like I'm more of a backend rather than a front-end type of developer

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-basics-by-building-a-card-component/) - This helped me for build the component. Just following the pattern of the division tags or what we call **"div"** tags and after that just modify the component like the preview shown from the front-end mentor
